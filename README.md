# Deep-Learning-Portfolio
portfolio of Deep Learning projects based on Artificial Neuaral Networks(ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN), Long short term memory(LSTM) and Gated Recurrent units(GRU). 

[Airline passenger prediction](https://github.com/krishnavamshikorpal/Deep-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Airline%20Passengers%20prediction/international%20airline%20passengers%20prediction.ipynb) :  Developed a neural network model for a time series prediction problem using the Keras deep learning library. Predicted passengers for next 6 months. The window(time steps) approach to frame a time series prediction problem and develop a neural network model.

[MNIST Handwritten digits](https://github.com/krishnavamshikorpal/Deep-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/MNIST_Hand_written_numbers.ipynb) : The MNIST database of handwritten digits has a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Created a Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) model that recognizes the handwritten digits.
